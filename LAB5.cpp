/*Create a class named Shape with a function that prints "This is a shape". Create another class named Polygon inheriting the Shape class with the same function that prints "Polygon is a shape". Create two other classes named Rectangle and Triangle having the same function which prints "Rectangle is a polygon" and "Triangle is a polygon" respectively. Again, make another class named Square having the same function which prints "Square is a rectangle‚Äù. Now, try calling the function by the object of each of these classes.*/
